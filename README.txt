This game is a modified version of pac-man created from an exsisting
base by CodingWith-Adam

// How to play //
To play, move your characters with the arrow keys. Try to avoid
touching the slime enemies or it's game over!

To defeat the slime enemies, pick up a piece of ham from one of the 
4 map corners.

// Tech Used //
- JS / CSS / HTML with no frameworks
- VS code

// bugs and unfinished features //
While the game currently has no major bugs, there are some features
I did not get to add.

Due to losing 1 week of the 2 week timeline to work and coding issues,
I was unable to add more od the features I would have liked.

These include:
- a scoreboard
- a way to add enemies to the map once more after defeat
- a game win/over with the same font as the rest
- cleaner less repetitive code
- better inner borders
